    <div class="page red">
        <h1>Red</h1>
        <h2>Impulsive yet Confident</h2>
        <p>Red auras shine with an aggressive energy; they are fearless and face obstacles with no hesistation. Combined with
            a high self-confidence, their aggression results in them being impulsive at times. Reds are also proud of their
            own abilties and do not take defeat well.

    <div class="page orange">
        <h1>Orange</h1>
        <h2>Chaotic yet Independent</h2>
        <p>Orange auras love chaos and anarchy. There is nothing that pisses oranges more than answering to an authoritative figure 
            and they will go to great lengths to break and circumvent rules given by those people. Their hate of authority also makes
            them very independent and self-sufficient. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page yellow">
        <h1>Yellow</h1>
        <h2>Loud yet Opinionated</h2>
        <p>Yellow auras are often called out for being loud or annoying. They enjoy commanding a conversation and being at the center of
            attention. Their loud demeanour gets them a reputation for being highly opinionated and outspoken, making them great at
            leading discussions and brainstorming.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page green">
        <h1>Green</h1>
        <h2>Obstinate yet Determined</h2>
        <p>Green auras are stubborn and will not settle for anything less than what they expect. They demand that anything they want be
            given to them, regardless of any factor. This also makes them relentless, and they pursue any goal with determination without
            ever giving up.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page blue">
        <h1>Blue</h1>
        <h2>Isolated yet Calm</h2>
        <p>Blue auras often feel isolated and distant from other people. They like to avoid large social gatherings, instead preferring to
            be by themselves or among close friends. They are also resilient to emotions and are able to 
            stay calm and in control even in the worst situations.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page purple">
        <h1>Purple</h1>
        <h2>Submissive yet Caring</h2>
        <p>Purple auras live life with an 'anything goes' mentality. They adapt to any situation and often sacrifice their own needs for the 
            needs of someone they consider more important. Their selflessness makes them caring but often leaves them hurt or used by
            other people.
